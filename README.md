Hubway Data Visualization
=============
In 2012 Hubway released half a million trips from their bicycle sharing system located in Boston, they hosted a data visualization challenge.They increased the number of trips to now over 1,500,000, and included data about their stations across Boston. http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/ 

This repository includes python scripts analyzing the trip and station data as a part of my Senior Project.

I worked in conjunction with John Jannotti, a proffesor at Brown University
